Which method is most suitable and why?

Both methods are correct and produce the same output. However, the second method is more efficient and suitable for several reasons:

Avoids modifying the original string: In the first method, the StringBuilder s is modified repeatedly by replacing substrings. This can be inefficient, especially for large strings. In contrast, the second method creates a new StringBuilder s1 to build the output string, leaving the original string s unchanged.

Reduces number of operations: The first method performs replace operations on the original string, which can be costly. The second method only appends to the new StringBuilder s1, which is a more efficient operation.

Easier to understand and maintain: The second method is more straightforward and easier to understand, as it builds the output string incrementally without modifying the original string.

Less prone to errors: The second method is less likely to introduce errors, as it doesn't modify the original string and avoids the potential issues that come with modifying a string while iterating over it.

In general, when working with strings, it's often better to create a new string or StringBuilder to build the output, rather than modifying the original string. This approach leads to more efficient, readable, and maintainable code.
