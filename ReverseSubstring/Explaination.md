_Which method is most suitable and why?_

Both methods are correct and produce the same output. However, the second method is more efficient and suitable for several reasons:

_Avoids modifying the original string:_ In the first method, the StringBuilder s is modified repeatedly by replacing substrings. This can be inefficient, especially for large strings. In contrast, the second method creates a new StringBuilder s1 to build the output string, leaving the original string s unchanged.

_Reduces number of operations:_ The first method performs replace operations on the original string, which can be costly. The second method only appends to the new StringBuilder s1, which is a more efficient operation.

_Easier to understand and maintain:_ The second method is more straightforward and easier to understand, as it builds the output string incrementally without modifying the original string.

_Less prone to errors:_ The second method is less likely to introduce errors, as it doesn't modify the original string and avoids the potential issues that come with modifying a string while iterating over it.

In general, when working with strings, it's often better to create a new string or StringBuilder to build the output, rather than modifying the original string. This approach leads to more efficient, readable, and maintainable code.
